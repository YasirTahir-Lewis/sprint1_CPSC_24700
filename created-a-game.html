    <h1>Created a game</h1>
    <p>I created an application and it was kind of a game, I was really proud of myself creating something complex like that. I wrote it in JAVA in object Oriented Programming class, it's called Vegas baby Vegas and it's basically a spinning machine and you would gamble money to see if the colors or shape matches then you would win some money and it will added in to your balance. I will share a link below to github where it is uploaded. It's in SlotMachinePart2 folder.</p>
